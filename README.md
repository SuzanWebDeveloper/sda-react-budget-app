# React Fundamental

This repository contains a React application to manage incomes, expenses, and saving targets. The application is built using TypeScript and focuses on fundamental concepts.

The application includes the following features:

- UI for a one-page application to store incomes, expenses, and saving targets, saving amount
- add income sources, value and date.
- add expense sources, value, and date.
- add the value of the target saving.
- add the value of the saving amount.
- Calculate the account balance using the formula: income - expense - saving = balance.
- transfer the balance amount to the saving amount.
- Calculate the total of the current saving and the percentage of the current saving amount / target of saving.
- remove items in income and expense sources.
- Validate the input income, expense, target of income, and saving account using React Hook Form.
- Applying React Router so when users access "/budget-app", it will render the Budget component.
- Applying advanced React hooks, useCallback to optimize performance.
